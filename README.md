In order to use our program, you will first need at least one location in mind to retrieve a
weather report from. The program will prompt you to enter a location in the format <City,
State>. The state can be entered in any format (ex: Texas, TX, Tx, texas), and the city can be
entered similarly (College Station, college station). The program will then prompt you to enter
“Y” or “y” if you would like to save the report to a file, or to enter “N” or “n” if you would
simply like to output the report to the console. The program will then display a header, telling
you which fields it has gathered, and then the data it has gathered. It will then ask you in the
same format as the “save to file” prompt if you would like to search for another location, at
which point, the whole process will restart.
